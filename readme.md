# Angular-Tour-of-Heroes

## [Tutorial: Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/tutorial)

The grand plan for this tutorial is to build an app that helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes.

The Tour of Heroes app covers the core fundamentals of Angular. You'll build a basic app that has many of the features you'd expect to find in a full-blown, data-driven app: acquiring and displaying a list of heroes, editing a selected hero's detail, and navigating among different views of heroic data.

You'll use built-in directives to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data. You'll create components to display hero details and show an array of heroes. You'll use one-way data binding for read-only data. You'll add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding. You'll bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks. You'll enable users to select a hero from a master list and edit that hero in the details view. You'll format data with pipes. You'll create a shared service to assemble the heroes. And you'll use routing to navigate among different views and their components.

You'll learn enough core Angular to get started and gain confidence that Angular can do whatever you need it to do. You'll cover a lot of ground at an introductory level, and you'll find many links to pages with greater depth.
